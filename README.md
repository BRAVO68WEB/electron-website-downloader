Once you enter a URL and push the "Start Grabbing" button, the application will:

- Open the website & download all resources in that page
- Get a list of all links to the same domain & load those
- Get a list of all media queries & loop over all pages for all specified media query widths

You will find a folder containing all loaded resources on your Desktop.
